					<h2 class="display-4">About Me</h2>
					<p class="indent">Hi, my name is Shianne Lee. I am currently pursuing a degree in software development. Throughout my years in this program, I have been provided with strong technical and business skills. I have also obtained knowledge on multiple programming languages. I am able to work within teams and also individually as I do with many school projects and assignments. When problems arise within a project, it can be hard to stay positive but I practise to stay focused under pressure. I help to identify problems and implement solutions. I am also good with leading teams to finishing projects on time and within target quality. For many of my group assignments, I have taken up the position of leading the group and have met the deadlines that are required. I am looking for a position that will be able to enhance my programming knowledge and provide many years of experience.</p>

					<h2 class="display-4">Skills</h2>
					<p class="indent">Over the years, in the Software Development program as well as on my own, I have developed some skills that will be an asset to an organization. Through school, I have learned many programming languages and worked on many projects with and within team members. This has given me the ability to handle situations on my own as well as with others. As school requires many deadlines, I have managed to handle working under pressure and staying positive during those times. I am also able to help find solutions and solve problems. At various times, I have found myself leading teams inside and outside of school. I have met deadlines and made sure the projects were of high quality.</p>

					<h2 class="display-4">Artifacts</h2>
					<h5>Hello Healthy!</h5>
					<p class="indent">This started as an assignment for my Android course. It is a weight tracker, calorie counter, and goal setter. After the course finished, I continued to work on it. This is still a work in progress. This is located on Github at <a href="https://github.com/ShianneLee/HelloHealthy">/HelloHealthy</a>.</p>

					<h5>Student Relationship Management System</h5>
					<p class="indent">This project was created for the school's IT program coordinators. It involved recording each interaction a coordinator had with a student. This helped to remove some issues between coordinators when dealing with the same students. My involvement in this project was creating some of the pages and testing them.</p>
					
					<h5>Graded Work Due Date Monitor</h5>
					<p class="indent">This assignment was started in my ASP.NET MVC course. It should allow professors to add course work such as assignments and labs to it. It shows professors all their students and courses, students all their courses and grades, and kept all assignments and grades in one place.</p>
